# Instagram Clone

This is an Instagram clone website that aims to replicate the functionality and design of the popular social media platform. Currently, it only includes the homepage where users can view posts from other users.

## Features

- **Homepage**: The homepage displays a feed of posts from different users. Each post includes the username, profile picture, photo, caption, and the number of likes and comments. Users can scroll through the feed to view different posts.

## Installation

To set up the Instagram clone website locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/your-username/instagram-clone.git
  ```
  
2. Navigate to the project directory:

  ```
  cd instagram-clone
  ```

3. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

## Usage
Once the homepage is loaded, you can scroll through the feed to view different posts. However, please note that currently, only the homepage is implemented, and no user authentication or posting functionality is available.
